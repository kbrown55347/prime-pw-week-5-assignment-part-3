    <h4>Questions:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Is there a way to rename a commit? I messed up a commit while
      naming it and one of my commits in github for this assignment is
      now titled "Created and tested search function) pwd" 🤷🏻‍♀️ </li>
      <li>The last task in the stretch goals said to display the list of tracks for
      each album in the showCollection function. It asked for them to be listed in
      numbered format. I wasn't sure how to get it to look like that, so I added
      the object with the tracks on line 122 in the js file. If possible, could
      we go over that task in office hours next week?</li>
